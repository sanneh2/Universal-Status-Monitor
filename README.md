# ðŸš€ Universal Status Monitor

**A versatile Node.js server for monitoring various services and automatically updating Atlassian Status Page components.**

## Overview

This Node.js server is designed to be a universal status monitor, providing a flexible solution for monitoring different services and updating the Atlassian Status Page component accordingly. It supports templating, allowing you to easily adapt it to monitor various services of your choice.

## Prerequisites

Before using the monitor, ensure you have the following:

- Node.js installed
- API credentials for the services you want to monitor
- Atlassian Status Page API key and page ID

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sanneh2/universal-status-monitor.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd universal-status-monitor
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Create a .env file in the project root and set the following environment variables:

```env
STATUSPAGE_API_KEY=your_atlassian_statuspage_api_key
PAGE_ID=your_atlassian_statuspage_page_id
SERVICE_API_URL=your_service_api_url
```

Replace placeholders with your actual values.

5. Run the server:

```bash
npm start
```

The server will start running on http://localhost:3000.

## Configuration

- `STATUSPAGE_API_KEY`: Your Atlassian Status Page API key. \*\* important
- `PAGE_ID`: Your Atlassian Status Page ID. \*\* important
- `COMPONENT_ID`: Your Atlassian Status Page component ID (e.g., `c6ct8jfdfc9s`). \*\* important
- `SERVICE_API_SECRET`: Your Magic Bell API secret key. (optional)
- `SERVICE_API_KEY`: Your Magic Bell API key.(optional)
- `INCIDENT_TITLE`: Title for incidents triggered when the service is down (e.g., `The magical elves you are looking for are not here`). (optional)
- `RESOLUTION_TITLE`: Title for incidents when the service is resolved (e.g., `The service is back online!`). (optional)

## Templating and Extending

This monitor is highly extensible and can be easily templated to monitor various services. Simply modify the updateStatuspageIncident function in server.js to adapt it to your specific service's API response.

## Automation with Cron

To automate status updates, schedule a cron job to run the monitor at regular intervals:

# Atlassian Statuspage Automation

Automate the management of incidents on Atlassian Statuspage using Node.js and cron jobs.

## Features

1. **Incident Creation and Resolution**

   - Automatically create and resolve incidents on Atlassian Statuspage based on the status of your monitored API.

2. **Daily System Health Check**

   - Perform a daily system health check, creating an incident on Atlassian Statuspage if necessary, to showcase the system's operational status.

3. **Independent Daily Health Check**

   - Ensure the daily system health check is independent of the regular monitoring cron job, providing a comprehensive overview of the system's health.

4. **Memory Storage of Incident ID**

   - Utilize in-memory storage to keep track of the ongoing incident ID while the server is running.

5. **RESTful Endpoints**

   - Expose RESTful endpoints for triggering the middleware and checking the server's health.

6. **User-Friendly Routes**
   - Easy-to-use routes for navigating and triggering essential functionalities.
